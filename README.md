Get big files out of a smartphone in a wireless world

Wifiupload let you upload large files from a smartphone. Two
themes are available for the user: light or dark. A
progress bar is also featured. It's a command line tool so
no graphical interface are proposed. It works on any terminal.
But a nice graphical interface is shown on the smartphone.
If the transfer is too slow blam your ISP which restrict
the TX speed.
